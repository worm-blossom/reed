            <Bib item="meyer2023sok">Prefix authentication schemes</Bib> — usually called <I>append-only logs</I>, or <I>transparency logs</I> — are cryptographic schemes to efficiently authenticate total ordering between events. For any two events from a single event stream, you can provide a short digest to certify that one happened before the other (as opposed to them happening concurrently). <Def n="name" r="Reed"/> is a lightweigh specification for implementing the <Bib item="meyer2023better"><M>SLLS_3</M> scheme</Bib>, a scheme that produces shorter proofs than the traditional <Bib item="laurie2021rfc">certificate transparency logs</Bib>.

          <Rb n="name"/> supersedes the earlier <A href="https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/bamboo">Bamboo</A> specification. <Rb n="name"/> is more efficient than Bamboo, more minimalistic in feature set, and generic over any particular cryptographic primitives. Bamboo was originally designed for efficient data replication, but I have since come to prefer <A href="https://willowprotocol.org/">more flexible replication technologies</A>, so <R n="name"/> sheds its data replication origins.

        How about a dense one-paragraph summary, followed by a step-by-step explanation with pictures?

      <P>
        <Rb n="name"/> is a <Bib item="meyer2023sok">transitive prefix authentication scheme</Bib>: given a sequence of events, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG), whose edges correspond to one object containing a secure hash of the other object (i.e., a Merkle-DAG). For each event, we assign a <Dfn>commitment vertex</Dfn> which has a path to the event, as well as paths to the commitment vertices of all earlier events. Given the commitment vertices of two events and the out-neighborhood of the path between them, we can reconstruct the hashes of all path vertices, thus proving that the first event did indeed happen before the other. <Rb n="name"/> guarantees that the out-neighborhoods of these paths are small, i.e., verification is efficient.
      </P>

      <P>
        Let’s break this down step by step. We start out with an ordered sequence of events, nine in the following example:
      </P>

      <Fig

      </Fig>

      <P>
        These events will form the basis of a graph. To ensure <Em>efficient</Em> prefix authentication, we first need to add some additional vertices. You do not yet need to care <Em>how</Em> we determine these, we are just getting a feel for the general concepts here.
      </P>

      <Fig

          <P>
            We added some further vertices, according to rules we cover later.

          src={<ResolveAsset asset={["graphics", "vertices.svg"]} />}
        />
      </Fig>

      <P>
        Next, we add edges to turn these vertices into a useful graph. We are building a Merkle-DAG, which means that each vertex is labeled with a secure hash of the concatenation of the labels of its <Sidenote note={<>This is a slight oversimplification, <R n="name"/> proper also concatenates some metadata into the labels.</>}>out-neighbors</Sidenote>. We need not visualize the labels, since they follow deterministically from the structure of the graph.

      <Fig

        caption={<>
          <P>
            We add some edges. These follow a useful pattern, I promise. Can you smell the ternary almost-skip-list already?

        To illustrate prefix authentication, we now arbitrarily select two events and highlight the path between their commitment vertices.

        Continuing<Marginale>Note how the same <R n="digest"/> may appear multiple times in a <R n="certificate"/>. We could easily define a compressed version of prefix certificates that eliminates all but the first occurence of duplicate hashes, but verifying these becomes more difficult. Duplicates are rare enough (they only occur when the <M>y</M> coordinate of a <R n="jump"/> decreases strictly, which only happens toward the <Quotes>top-left of the graph</Quotes>) that we opted for the simpler verification procedure over the slight, best-case certificate size reductions.</Marginale> the example from <Rc n="fig_large_path"/>:<Br/>The <R n="certificate"/> of <M>(6, 0)</M> and <M>(20, 0)</M> is the sequence of the <Rs n="digest"/> of <M post=".">((5, 0), 6, (3, 1), (9, 0), (3, 1), (18, 1), 19, 20)</M>

          Given a sequence <M><DefValue n="claimed" r="cert"/> = (d_0, d_1, \ldots, l_k)</M> of <Rs n="digest"/> and a claim that <R n="claimed"/> is the <R n="certificate"/> of two <Rs n="commitment"/> <M>(<DefValue n="claim_x1" r="x_1"/>, 0)</M> with <R n="label"/> <M><DefValue n="label_1"/></M> and <M>(<DefValue n="claim_x2" r="x_2"/>, 0)</M> with <R n="label"/> <M post=","><DefValue n="label_2"/></M> you can iteratively verify that claim. To verify, use the information in <R n="claimed"/> to compute the labels of the <R n="shortest"/> from <M>(<R n="claim_x2"/>, 0)</M> to <M>(<R n="claim_x1"/>, 0)</M> — successively and in reverse order. If the labels that you compute this way for <M>(<R n="claim_x1"/>, 0)</M> and <M>(<R n="claim_x2"/>, 0)</M> match <R n="label_1"/> and <R n="label_2"/> respectively, then you have successfully verified the <R n="certificate"/>. Assuming abscence of hash collisions, this proves that the sequence of all events up to <R n="event"/> <R n="claim_x1"/> is a prefix of the sequence of all events up to <R n="event"/> <R n="claim_x2"/>. Hence, in particular, <R n="event"/> <R n="claim_x1"/> happened before <R n="event"/> <R n="claim_x2"/>.

        And that is how someone else can efficiently prove to you that some event happened before another. For the use-case of transparency logs, a logging authority would sign <Rs n="commitment"/>. Signed <Rs n="commitment"/> would take on the role of <A href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9162.html#name-signed-tree-head-sth">signed tree heads</A> in that scenario.
